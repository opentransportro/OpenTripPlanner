## Changelog
- Initial version of Legacy Graph QL API (September 2020)

## Documentation

This is a copy of HSL's GraphQL API used by the Digitransit project. The API is used to run OTP2
 together with the [digitransit-ui](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui).
 
### OTP2 Official GraphQL API (Not available) 
We **plan** to make a new offical OTP2 API, replacing the REST API. The plan is to base the new API
on this API and the [Legacy GraphQL Api](LegacyGraphQLApi.md). The new API will most likely have 2 
"translations": A GTFS version and a Transmodel version, we will try to keep the semantics the same.  

### Configuration
To enable this you need to add the feature `SandboxAPILegacyGraphQLApi`.
