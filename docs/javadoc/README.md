# OTP JavaDoc


With OTP2, we are not targeting use of OTP as a library, so HTML Javadoc is
not as relevant. Use the source artifact, github or an IDE to explore the
code instead.

Maven Central Repository require javadoc to be present, but it is ok to
provide a fake one:

> If, for some reason (for example, license issue or it's a Scala project), you can not provide
> -sources.jar or -javadoc.jar , please make fake -sources.jar or -javadoc.jar with simple README
> inside to pass the checking. We do not want to disable the rules because some people tend to skip
> it if they have an option and we want to keep the quality of the user experience as high as
> possible.

See: [Maven Central Repository - Requirements](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/requirements.html)

There is no JavaDoc provided for OTP, use the source artifact, github or an ide to explore the code.
